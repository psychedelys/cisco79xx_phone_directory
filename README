# Usage

Backup your Google Contacts, own cloud contact, LDAP stuff is one csv file.

The resulting CSV file should be named 'contacts_extract.csv' and located in the
directory where the phone directory script resides.

If you haven't already, install the Flask Python Microframework using
"easy_install Flask", or visit http://flask.pocoo.org for more information.

The Flask built-in webserver can be used for testing purposes from your
browser. However, this webserver uses HTTP/1.0 by default, which is not
supported by the Cisco 79xx IP phones. Therefore, it is recommended that
you use a production-safe webserver, such as Apache + mod_wsgi.

For more information on WSGI deployment, such as the required Apache
configuration, read the official Flask documentation at:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/mod_wsgi/

If needed, review the variables at the top of the script and set them
according to your needs.

You will also need to edit the SIPDefault.cnf file located at the root
of your TFTP server to add a line such as this one:
directory_url: "http://192.168.178.20:5006/directory.xml"

You will need to edit the script file HOST variable to reflect your change also.

# Limitations

The Cisco 79xx IP phones support up to 32 entries per directory page. This
is the motivation behind having a contacts search page since most people
have more than 32 contacts on their {Google|ownCloud|LDAP|Phone} Contacts account.
